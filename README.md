Installation and Setup
---

live version is accessible at https://alex.lukin.family/

but if you want to setup it localy, you can clone repo and run docker-compose inside of it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Perchinka/My-Site.git
cd MySite
docker-compose up --build
```
Once it's up and running, you can access the website at http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Appendix

**Just my little project**

The website is a work in progress, and the version on the live site may differ from the one on Git. I'll update it soon!
